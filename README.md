# Sampling
This project performs various sampling techniques and evaluates their performance on machine learning models.

## Steps

1. **Download the dataset**: From the provided GitHub link.
2. **Balance the dataset**: Using SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
3. **Apply sampling techniques**: Random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling.
4. **Train ML models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Decision Tree.
5. **Evaluate results**: Accuracy is recorded for each model and sampling technique.

## Results

| Sampling Technique | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting | SVM | Decision Tree |
